# PythonReverseShellwithNgrok
 This is a python reverse shell with ngrok
 To use it you have to download [Ngrok](https://www.ngrok.com) and create your account.

 The python file uses socket so you wont need any librarys.

 After you downloaded ngrok just add your auth key and than run this command:
 `ngrok tcp 9999`

 You can change the port in the python file, but if you change it you have to write it also in the ngrok command like this:
 `ngrok tcp *your port*`

 If you need any help with this just join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/WrKjFQ5a5C).
